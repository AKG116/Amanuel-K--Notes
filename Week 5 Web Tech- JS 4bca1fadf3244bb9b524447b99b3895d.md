# Week 5 Web Tech- JS

**Day 9**

## Higher Order Function

Higher order functions are functions which take other function as a parameter or return a function as a value. The function passed as a parameter is called callback.

### Callback

A callback is a function which can be passed as parameter to other function. See the example below.

```
// a callback function, the name of the function could be any name
const callback = (n) => {
  return n ** 2
}

// function that takes other function as a callback
function cube(callback, n) {
  return callback(n) * n
}

console.log(cube(callback, 3))
```

### Returning function

Higher order functions return function as a value

```
// Higher order function returning an other function
const higherOrder = n => {
  const doSomething = m => {
    const doWhatEver = t => {
      return 2 * n + 3 * m + t
    }
    return doWhatEver
  }
  return doSomething
}
console.log(higherOrder(2)(3)(10))
```

Let us see were we use call back functions. For instance the *forEach* method uses call back.

`const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const sumArray = arr => {
  let sum = 0
  const callback = function(element) {
    sum += element
  }
  arr.forEach(callback)
  return sum

}
console.log(sumArray(numbers))`

## Functional Programming

Instead of writing regular loop, latest version of JavaScript introduced lots of built in methods which can help us to solve complicated problems. All builtin methods take callback function. In this section, we will see *forEach*, *map*, *filter*, *reduce*, *find*, *every*, *some*, and *sort*.

### forEach

*forEach*: Iterate an array elements. We use *forEach* only with arrays. It takes a callback function with elements, index parameter and array itself. The index and the array optional.

```
arr.forEach(function (element, index, arr) {
  console.log(index, element, arr)
})
// The above code can be written using arrow function
arr.forEach((element, index, arr) => {
  console.log(index, element, arr)
})
// The above code can be written using arrow function and explicit return
arr.forEach((element, index, arr) => console.log(index, element, arr))
```

```
let sum = 0;
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
numbers.forEach(num => console.log(num))
console.log(sum)
```

`1
2
3
4
5`

### filter

*Filter*: Filter out items which full fill filtering conditions and return a new array.

```
//Filter countries containing land
const countriesContainingLand = countries.filter((country) =>
  country.includes('land')
)
console.log(countriesContainingLand)
```

`['Finland', 'Ireland']`

### reduce

*reduce*: Reduce takes a callback function. The call back function takes accumulator, current, and optional initial value as a parameter and returns a single value. It is a good practice to define an initial value for the accumulator value. If we do not specify this parameter, by default accumulator will get array `first value`. If our array is an *empty array*, then `Javascript` will throw an error.

```
arr.reduce((acc, cur) => {
  // some operations goes here before returning a value
 return
}, initialValue)
```

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, cur) => acc + cur, 0)

console.log(sum)
```

`15`

### every

*every*: Check if all the elements are similar in one aspect. It returns boolean

```
const names = ['Asabeneh', 'Mathias', 'Elias', 'Brook']
const areAllStr = names.every((name) => typeof name === 'string') // Are all strings?

console.log(areAllStr)
```

`true`

### Sorting Object Arrays

Whenever we sort objects in an array, we use the object key to compare. Let us see the example below.

`objArr.sort(function (a, b) {
  if (a.key < b.key) return -1
  if (a.key > b.key) return 1
  return 0
})

// or

objArr.sort(function (a, b) {
  if (a['key'] < b['key']) return -1
  if (a['key'] > b['key']) return 1
  return 0
})

const users = [
  { name: 'Asabeneh', age: 150 },
  { name: 'Brook', age: 50 },
  { name: 'Eyob', age: 100 },
  { name: 'Elias', age: 22 },
]
users.sort((a, b) => {
  if (a.age < b.age) return -1
  if (a.age > b.age) return 1
  return 0
})
console.log(users) // sorted ascending
// [{…}, {…}, {…}, {…}]`

**DAY 10**

## Set

Set is a collection of elements. Set can only contains unique elements. Let us see how to create a set in the section below.

### Creating an empty set

```
const companies = new Set()
console.log(companies)
```

```
Set(0) {}
```

### Creating set from array

```
const languages = [
  'English',
  'Finnish',
  'English',
  'French',
  'Spanish',
  'English',
  'French',
]

const setOfLanguages = new Set(languages)
console.log(setOfLanguages)
```

`Set(4) {"English", "Finnish", "French", "Spanish"}`

### Adding an element to a set

```
const companies = new Set() // creating an empty set
console.log(companies.size) // 0

companies.add('Google') // add element to the set
companies.add('Facebook')
companies.add('Amazon')
companies.add('Oracle')
companies.add('Microsoft')
console.log(companies.size) // 5 elements in the set
console.log(companies)
```

`Set(5) {"Google", "Facebook", "Amazon", "Oracle", "Microsoft"}`

### Deleting an element a set

We can delete an element from a set using a delete method.

```
console.log(companies.delete('Google'))
console.log(companies.size) // 4 elements left in the set
```

### Checking an element in the set

The has method can help to know if a certain element exists in a set.

`console.log(companies.has('Apple')) // false
console.log(companies.has('Facebook')) // true`

### Union of sets

To find a union to two sets can be achieved using spread operator. Lets find the union of set A and set B (A U B)

```
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let b = [3, 4, 5, 6]
let c = [...a, ...b]

let A = new Set(a)
let B = new Set(b)
let C = new Set(c)

console.log(C)
```

```
Set(6) {1, 2, 3, 4, 5,6}
```

### Intersection of sets

To find an intersection of two sets can be achieved using filter. Lets find the intersection of set A and set B (A ∩ B)

```
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let b = [3, 4, 5, 6]

let A = new Set(a)
let B = new Set(b)

let c = a.filter((num) => B.has(num))
let C = new Set(c)

console.log(C)
```

```
Set(3) {3, 4, 5}
```

### Difference of sets

To find an the difference between two sets can be achieved using filter. Lets find the different of set A and set B (A \ B)

```
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let b = [3, 4, 5, 6]

let A = new Set(a)
let B = new Set(b)

let c = a.filter((num) => !B.has(num))
let C = new Set(c)

console.log(C)
```

`Set(2) {1, 2}`

## Map

### Creating an empty Map

```
const map = new Map()
console.log(map)
```

```
Map(0) {}
```

### Creating an Map from array

```
countries = [
  ['Finland', 'Helsinki'],
  ['Sweden', 'Stockholm'],
  ['Norway', 'Oslo'],
]
const map = new Map(countries)
console.log(map)
console.log(map.size)
```

`Map(3) {"Finland" => "Helsinki", "Sweden" => "Stockholm", "Norway" => "Oslo"}
3`

**DAY 11**

Destructuring is a way to unpack arrays, and objects and assigning to a distinct variable.

### Destructing Arrays

```
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3]
  let [numOne, numTwo, numThree] = numbers

  console.log(numOne, numTwo, numThree)
```

```
  1 2 3
```

```
  const names = ['Asabeneh', 'Brook', 'David', 'John']
  let [firstPerson, secondPerson, thirdPerson, fourthPerson] = names

  console.log(firstPerson, secondPerson,thirdPerson, fourthPerson)
```

```
Asabeneh Brook David John
```

```
  const scientificConstants = [2.72, 3.14, 9.81, 37, 100]
  let [e, pi, gravity, bodyTemp, boilingTemp] = scientificConstants

  console.log(e,pi,gravity, bodyTemp, boilingTemp)
```

```
2.72 3.14 9.81 37 100
```

```
const fullStack = [
  ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JS', 'React'],
  ['Node', 'Express', 'MongoDB']
]
const [frontEnd, backEnd] = fullStack

console.log(frontEnd)
console.log(backEnd)
```

```
["HTML", "CSS", "JS", "React"]
["Node", "Express", "MongoDB"]
```

If we like to skip on of the values in the array we use additional comma. The comma helps to omit the value at that specific index

```
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3]
  let [numOne, , numThree] = numbers //2 is omitted

  console.log(numOne, numThree)
```

`1 3`

### Destructuring during iteration

```
const countries = [['Finland', 'Helsinki'], ['Sweden', 'Stockholm'], ['Norway', 'Oslo']]

for (const [country, city] of countries) {
console.log(country, city)
}
```

`Finland Helsinki
Sweden Stockholm
Norway Oslo`

### Renaming during structuring

```
const rectangle = {
  width: 20,
  height: 10,
  area: 200
}
let { width: w, height: h, area: a, perimeter: p } = rectangle

console.log(w, h, a, p)
```

`20 10 200 undefined`

### Spread operator to get the rest of array elements

```
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
let [num1, num2, num3, ...rest] = nums

console.log(num1, num2, num3)
console.log(rest)
```

`1 2 3
[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`

### Spread operator to copy array

```
const evens = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
const evenNumbers = [...evens]

const odds = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
const oddNumbers = [...odds]

const wholeNumbers = [...evens, ...odds]

console.log(evenNumbers)
console.log(oddNumbers)
console.log(wholeNumbers)

```

`[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`

### Spread operator to copy object

We can copy an object using a spread operator

```
const user = {
  name:'Asabeneh',
  title:'Programmer',
  country:'Finland',
  city:'Helsinki'
}

const copiedUser = {...user}
console.log(copiedUser)
```

`{name: "Asabeneh", title: "Programmer", country: "Finland", city: "Helsinki"}`

**DAY 12**

## Regular Expressions

A regular expression or RegExp is a small programming language that helps to find pattern in data. A RegExp can be used to check if some pattern exists in a different data types. To use RegExp in JavaScript either we use RegExp constructor or we can declare a RegExp pattern using two forward slashes followed by a flag. We can create a pattern in two ways.

To declare a string we use a single quote, double quote a backtick to declare a regular expression we use two forward slashes and an optional flag. The flag could be g, i, m, s, u or y.

### RegExp parameters

A regular expression takes two parameters. One required search pattern and an optional flag.

### Pattern

A pattern could be a text or any form of pattern which some sort of similarity. For instance the word spam in an email could be a pattern we are interested to look for in an email or a phone number format number might be our interest to look for.

### Flags

Flags are optional parameters in a regular expression which determine the type of searching. Let us see some of the flags:

- g: a global flag which means looking for a pattern in whole text
- i: case insensitive flag(it searches for both lowercase and uppercase)
- m: multiline

### Creating a pattern with RegExp Constructor

Declaring regular expression without global flag and case insensitive flag.

```
// without flag
let pattern = 'love'
let regEx = new RegExp(pattern)
```

Declaring regular expression with global flag and case insensitive flag.

```
let pattern = 'love'
let flag = 'gi'
let regEx = new RegExp(pattern, flag)
```

Declaring a regex pattern using RegExp object. Writing the pattern and the flag inside the RegExp constructor

`let regEx = new RegExp('love','gi')`

### Square Bracket

Let's use square bracket to include lower and upper case

```
const pattern = '[Aa]pple' // this square bracket means either A or a
const txt = 'Apple and banana are fruits. An old cliche says an apple a day keeps the  doctor way has been replaced by a banana a day keeps the doctor far far away. '
const matches = txt.match(pattern)

console.log(matches)
```

```
["Apple", index: 0, input: "Apple and banana are fruits. An old cliche says an apple a day keeps the  doctor way has been replaced by a banana a day keeps the doctor far far away.", groups: undefined]

```

### Quantifier in RegExp

We can specify the length of the substring we look for in a text, using a curly bracket. Let us see, how ot use RegExp quantifiers. Imagine, we are interested in substring that their length are 4 characters

```
const txt = 'This regular expression example was made in December 6,  2019.'
const pattern = /\\b\w{4}\b/g  //  exactly four character words
const matches = txt.match(pattern)
console.log(matches)  //['This', 'made', '2019']
```

```
const txt = 'This regular expression example was made in December 6,  2019.'
const pattern = /\b[a-zA-Z]{4}\b/g  //  exactly four character  words without numbers
const matches = txt.match(pattern)
console.log(matches)  //['This', 'made']
```

```
const txt = 'This regular expression example was made in December 6,  2019.'
const pattern = /\d{4}/g  // a number and exactly four digits
const matches = txt.match(pattern)
console.log(matches)  // ['2019']
```

`const txt = 'This regular expression example was made in December 6,  2019.'
const pattern = /\d{1,4}/g   // 1 to 4
const matches = txt.match(pattern)
console.log(matches)  // ['6', '2019']`

**DAY 13**

## Console Object Methods

In this section, we will cover about console and console object methods. Absolute beginners usually do not know which to use: console.log(), document.write() or document.getElementById.

We use console object methods to show output on the browser console and we use document.write to show output on the browser document(view port). Both methods used only for testing and debugging purposes. The console method is the most popular testing and debugging tool on the browser. We use document.getElementById() when we like to interact with DOM try using JavaScript. We will cover DOM in another section.

In addition to the famous, console.log() method, the console provides other more methods.

### console.log()

We use console.log() to show output on the browser console. We can substitute values and also we can style the logging out put using %c.

- Showing output on browser console

```
console.log('30 Days of JavaScript')
```

```
30 Days of JavaScript
```

- Substitution

```
console.log('%d %s of JavaScript', 30, 'Days')
```

```
30 Days of JavaScript
```

- CSS

We can style logging message using css. Copy the following code and paste it on browser console to see the result.

`console.log('%c30 Days Of JavaScript', 'color:green') // log output is green
console.log(
  '%c30 Days%c %cOf%c %cJavaScript%c',
  'color:green',
  '',
  'color:red',
  '',
  'color:yellow'
) // log output green red and yellow text`

### console.warn()

We use console.warn() to give warning on browser. For instance to inform or warn deprecation of version of a package or bad practices. Copy the following code and paste it on browser console to see warning messages.

```
console.warn('This is a warning')
console.warn(
  'You are using React. Do not touch the DOM. Virtual DOM will take care of handling the DOM!'
)
console.warn('Warning is different from error')
```

### console.error()

The console.error() method shows an error messages.

`console.error('This is an error message')
console.error('We all make mistakes')`

### console.info()

It displays information message on browser console.

```
console.info('30 Days Of JavaScript challenge is trending on Github')
console.info('30 Days Of fullStack challenge might be released')
console.info('30 Days Of HTML and CSS challenge might be released')
```

### console.assert()

The console.assert() methods writes an error message to the console if the assertion is false. If the assertion is true, nothing happens. The first parameter is an assertion expression. If this expression is false, an Assertion failed error message will be displayed.

`console.assert(4 > 3, '4 is greater than 3') // no result
console.assert(3 > 4, '3 is not greater than 4') // Assertion failed: 3 is not greater than 4

for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i += 1) {
  let errorMessage = `${i} is not even`
  console.log('the # is ' + i)
  console.assert(i % 2 === 0, { number: i, errorMessage: errorMessage })
}`

### console.count()

It prints the number of times the console.count() is called. It takes a string label parameter. It is very helpful to count the number of times a function is called. In the following example, the console.count() method will run three times

```
const func = () => {
  console.count('Function has been called')
}
func()
func()
func()
```

```
Function has been called: 1
Function has been called: 2
Function has been called: 3
```

### console.clear()

The console.clear() cleans the browser console.

**DAY 14**

## Error Handling

JavaScript is a loosely-typed language. Some times you will get a runtime error when you try to access an undefined variable or call undefined function etc.

JavaScript similar to python or Java provides an error-handling mechanism to catch runtime errors using try-catch-finally block.

`try {
  // code that may throw an error
} catch (err) {
  // code to be executed if an error occurs
} finally {
  // code to be executed regardless of an error occurs or not
}`

### Error Types

- ReferenceError: An illegal reference has occurred. A ReferenceError is thrown if we use a variable that has not been declared.

```
let firstName = 'Asabeneh'
let fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName
console.log(fullName)
```

```
Uncaught ReferenceError: lastName is not defined
    at <anonymous>:2:35
```

- SyntaxError: A syntax error has occurred

```
let square = 2 x 2
console.log(square)
console.log('Hello, world")
```

```
Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
```

- TypeError: A type error has occurred

```
let num = 10
console.log(num.toLowerCase())
```

`Uncaught TypeError: num.toLowerCase is not a function
    at <anonymous>:2:17`

**DAY 15**

## Classes

JavaScript is an object oriented programming language. Everything in JavScript is an object, with its properties and methods. We create class to create an object. A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects. We instantiate a class to create an object. The class defines attributes and the behavior of the object, while the object, on the other hand, represents the class.

Once we create a class we can create object from it whenever we want. Creating an object from a class is called class instantiation.

In the object section, we saw how to create an object literal. Object literal is a singleton. If we want to get a similar object , we have to write it. However, class allows to create many objects. This helps to reduce amount of code and repetition of code.

### Defining a classes

To define a class in JavaScript we need the keyword *class* , the name of a class in **CamelCase** and block code(two curly brackets). Let us create a class name Person.

```
// syntax
class ClassName {
    //  code goes here
}

```

**Example:**

```
class Person {
  // code goes here
}
```

We have created an Person class but it does not have any thing inside.

### Class Instantiation

Instantiation class means creating an object from a class. We need the keyword *new* and we call the name of the class after the word new.

Let us create a dog object from our Person class.

```
class Person {
  // code goes here
}
const person = new Person()
console.log(person)
```

`Person {}`

### Class methods

The constructor inside a class is a builtin function which allow us to create a blueprint for the object. In a class we can create class methods. Methods are JavaScript functions inside the class. Let us create some class methods.

```
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName, age, country, city) {
    this.firstName = firstName
    this.lastName = lastName
    this.age = age
    this.country = country
    this.city = city
  }
  getFullName() {
    const fullName = this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName
    return fullName
  }
}

const person1 = new Person('Asabeneh', 'Yetayeh', 250, 'Finland', 'Helsinki')
const person2 = new Person('Lidiya', 'Tekle', 28, 'Finland', 'Espoo')

console.log(person1.getFullName())
console.log(person2.getFullName())
```

`Asabeneh Yetayeh
test.js:19 Lidiya Tekle`

## Inheritance

Using inheritance we can access all the properties and the methods of the parent class. This reduces repetition of code. If you remember, we have a Person parent class and we will create children from it. Our children class could be student, teach etc.

```
// syntax
class ChildClassName extends {
 // code goes here
}
```

Let us create a Student child class from Person parent class.

```
class Student extends Person {
  saySomething() {
    console.log('I am a child of the person class')
  }
}

const s1 = new Student('Asabeneh', 'Yetayeh', 'Finland', 250, 'Helsinki')
console.log(s1)
console.log(s1.saySomething())
console.log(s1.getFullName())
console.log(s1.getPersonInfo())
```

```
Student {firstName: "Asabeneh", lastName: "Yetayeh", age: "Finland", country: 250, city: "Helsinki", …}
I am a child of the person class
Asabeneh Yetayeh
Student {firstName: "Asabeneh", lastName: "Yetayeh", age: "Finland", country: 250, city: "Helsinki", …}
Asabeneh Yetayeh is Finland. He lives Helsinki, 250.
```

### Overriding methods

As you can see, we manage to access all the methods in the Person Class and we used it in the Student child class. We can customize the parent methods, we can add additional properties to a child class. If we want to customize, the methods and if we want to add extra properties, we need to use the constructor function the child class too. Inside the constructor function we call the super() function to access all the properties from the parent class. The Person class didn't have gender but now let us give gender property for the child class, Student. If the same method name used in the child class, the parent method will be overridden.

```
class Student extends Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName, age, country, city, gender) {
    super(firstName, lastName, age, country, city)
    this.gender = gender
  }

  saySomething() {
    console.log('I am a child of the person class')
  }
  getPersonInfo() {
    let fullName = this.getFullName()
    let skills =
      this.skills.length > 0 &&
      this.skills.slice(0, this.skills.length - 1).join(', ') +
        ` and ${this.skills[this.skills.length - 1]}`

    let formattedSkills = skills ? `He knows ${skills}` : ''
    let pronoun = this.gender == 'Male' ? 'He' : 'She'

    let info = `${fullName} is ${this.age}. ${pronoun} lives in ${this.city}, ${this.country}. ${formattedSkills}`
    return info
  }
}

const s1 = new Student(
  'Asabeneh',
  'Yetayeh',
  250,
  'Finland',
  'Helsinki',
  'Male'
)
const s2 = new Student('Lidiya', 'Tekle', 28, 'Finland', 'Helsinki', 'Female')
s1.setScore = 1
s1.setSkill = 'HTML'
s1.setSkill = 'CSS'
s1.setSkill = 'JavaScript'

s2.setScore = 1
s2.setSkill = 'Planning'
s2.setSkill = 'Managing'
s2.setSkill = 'Organizing'

console.log(s1)

console.log(s1.saySomething())
console.log(s1.getFullName())
console.log(s1.getPersonInfo())

console.log(s2.saySomething())
console.log(s2.getFullName())
console.log(s2.getPersonInfo())
```

`Student {firstName: "Asabeneh", lastName: "Yetayeh", age: 250, country: "Finland", city: "Helsinki", …}
Student {firstName: "Lidiya", lastName: "Tekle", age: 28, country: "Finland", city: "Helsinki", …}
I am a child of the person class
Asabeneh Yetayeh
Student {firstName: "Asabeneh", lastName: "Yetayeh", age: 250, country: "Finland", city: "Helsinki", …}
Asabeneh Yetayeh is 250. He lives in Helsinki, Finland. He knows HTML, CSS and JavaScript
I am a child of the person class
Lidiya Tekle
Student {firstName: "Lidiya", lastName: "Tekle", age: 28, country: "Finland", city: "Helsinki", …}
Lidiya Tekle is 28. She lives in Helsinki, Finland. He knows Planning, Managing and Organizing`

**Day 16**

**JSON**

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. The JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax, but the JSON format is text or string only. JSON is a light weight data format for storing and transporting. JSON is mostly used when data is sent from a server to a client. JSON is an easier-to-use alternative to XML.

**Example:**

```
{
"users":[
  {
    "firstName":"Asabeneh",
    "lastName":"Yetayeh",
    "age":250,
    "email":"asab@asb.com"
  },
  {
    "firstName":"Alex",
    "lastName":"James",
    "age":25,
    "email":"alex@alex.com"
  },
  {
  "firstName":"Lidiya",
  "lastName":"Tekle",
  "age":28,
  "email":"lidiya@lidiya.com"
  }
]
}
```

The above JSON example is not much different from a normal object. Then, what is the difference ? The difference is the key of a JSON object should be with double quotes or it should be a string. JavaScript Object and JSON are very similar that we can change JSON to Object and Object to JSON.

### Converting JSON to JavaScript Object

Mostly we fetch JSON data from HTTP response or from a file, but we can store the JSON as a string and we can change to Object for sake of demonstration. In JavaScript the keyword *JSON* has *parse()* and *stringify()* methods. When we want to change the JSON to an object we parse the JSON using *JSON.parse()*. When we want to change the object to JSON we use *JSON.stringify()*.

### JSON.parse()

```
JSON.parse(json[, reviver])
// json or text , the data
// reviver is an optional callback function
/* JSON.parse(json, (key, value) => {

})
*/
```

`const usersText = `{
"users":[
  {
    "firstName":"Asabeneh",
    "lastName":"Yetayeh",
    "age":250,
    "email":"asab@asb.com"
  },
  {
    "firstName":"Alex",
    "lastName":"James",
    "age":25,
    "email":"alex@alex.com"
  },
  {
  "firstName":"Lidiya",
  "lastName":"Tekle",
  "age":28,
  "email":"lidiya@lidiya.com"
  }
]
}`

const usersObj = JSON.parse(usersText, undefined, 4)
console.log(usersObj)`

### Converting Object to JSON

When we want to change the object to JSON we use *JSON.stringify()*. The stringify method takes one required parameter and two optional parameters. The replacer is used as filter and the space is an indentations. If we do not want to filter out any of the keys from the object we can just pass undefined.

`JSON.stringify(obj, replacer, space)
// json or text , the data
// reviver is an optional callback function`

### Using a Filter Array with JSON.stringify

Now, lets use the replacer as a filter. The user object has long list of keys but we are interested only in few of them. We put the keys we want to keep in array as show in the example and use it the place of the replacer.

```
const user = {
  firstName: 'Asabeneh',
  lastName: 'Yetayeh',
  country: 'Finland',
  city: 'Helsinki',
  email: 'alex@alex.com',
  skills: ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JavaScript', 'React', 'Python'],
  age: 250,
  isLoggedIn: false,
  points: 30
}

const txt = JSON.stringify(user,['firstName', 'lastName', 'country', 'city', 'age'],4)
console.log(txt)
```

```
{
    "firstName": "Asabeneh",
    "lastName": "Yetayeh",
    "country": "Finland",
    "city": "Helsinki",
    "age": 250
}
```

## HTML5 Web Storage

Web Storage(sessionStorage and localStorage) is a new HTML5 API offering important benefits over traditional cookies. Before HTML5, application data had to be stored in cookies, included in every server request. Web storage is more secure, and large amounts of data can be stored locally, without affecting website performance. The data storage limit of cookies in many web browsers is about 4 KB per cookie. We Storages can store far larger data (at least 5MB) and never transferred to the server. All sites from the same or one origin can store and access the same data.

The data being stored can be accessed using JavaScript, which gives you the ability to leverage client-side scripting to do many things that have traditionally involved server-side programming and relational databases. There are two Web Storage objects:

- sessionStorage
- localStorage

localStorage is similar to sessionStorage, except that while data stored in localStorage has no expiration time, data stored in sessionStorage gets cleared when the page session ends — that is, when the page is closed.

It should be noted that data stored in either localStorage or sessionStorage is specific to the protocol of the page.

The keys and the values are always strings (note that, as with objects, integer keys will be automatically converted to strings).

### sessionStorage

sessionStorage is only available within the browser tab or window session. It’s designed to store data in a single web page session. That means if the window is closed the session data will be removed. Since sessionStorage and localStorage has similar methods, we will focus only on localStorage.

### localStorage

The HTML5 localStorage is the para of the web storage API which is used to store data on the browser with no expiration data. The data will be available on the browser even after the browser is closed. localStorage is kept even between browser sessions. This means data is still available when the browser is closed and reopened, and also instantly between tabs and windows.

Web Storage data is, in both cases, not available between different browsers. For example, storage objects created in Firefox cannot be accessed in Internet Explorer, exactly like cookies. There are five methods to work on local storage: *setItem(), getItem(), removeItem(), clear(), key()*

### Use case of Web Storages

Some use case of Web Storages are

- store data temporarily
- saving products that the user places in his shopping cart
- data can be made available between page requests, multiple browser tabs, and also between browser sessions using localStorage
- can be used offline completely using localStorage
- Web Storage can be a great performance win when some static data is stored on the client to minimize the number of subsequent requests. Even images can be stored in strings using Base64 encoding.
- can be used for user authentication method

For the examples mentioned above, it makes sense to use localStorage. You may be wondering, then, when we should use sessionStorage.

In cases, we want to to get rid of the data as soon as the window is closed. Or, perhaps, if we do not want the application to interfere with the same application that’s open in another window. These scenarios are served best with sessionStorage.

Now, let us see how make use of these Web Storage APIs.

### Setting item to the localStorage

When we set data to be stored in a localStorage, it will be stored as a string. If we are storing an array or an object, we should stringify it first to keep the format unless otherwise we lose the array structure or the object structure of the original data.

We store data in the localStorage using the *localStorage.setItem* method.

```
//syntax
localStorage.setItem('key', 'value')
```

- Storing string in a localStorage

```
localStorage.setItem('firstName', 'Asabeneh') // since the value is string we do not stringify it
console.log(localStorage)
```

```
Storage {firstName: 'Asabeneh', length: 1}
```

- Storing number in a local storage

```
localStorage.setItem('age', 200)
console.log(localStorage)
```

```
 Storage {age: '200', firstName: 'Asabeneh', length: 2}
```

- Storing an array in a localStorage. If we are storing an array, an object or object array, we should stringify the object first. See the example below.

```
const skills = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JS', 'React']
//Skills array has to be stringified first to keep the format.
const skillsJSON = JSON.stringify(skills, undefined, 4)
localStorage.setItem('skills', skillsJSON)
console.log(localStorage)
```

```
Storage {age: '200', firstName: 'Asabeneh', skills: 'HTML,CSS,JS,React', length: 3}
```

```
let skills = [
  { tech: 'HTML', level: 10 },
  { tech: 'CSS', level: 9 },
  { tech: 'JS', level: 8 },
  { tech: 'React', level: 9 },
  { tech: 'Redux', level: 10 },
  { tech: 'Node', level: 8 },
  { tech: 'MongoDB', level: 8 }
]

let skillJSON = JSON.stringify(skills)
localStorage.setItem('skills', skillJSON)
```

- Storing an object in a localStorage. Before we storage objects to a localStorage, the object has to be stringified.

```
const user = {
  firstName: 'Asabeneh',
  age: 250,
  skills: ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JS', 'React']
}

const userText = JSON.stringify(user, undefined, 4)
localStorage.setItem('user', userText)
```

### Getting item from localStorage

We get data from the local storage using *localStorage.getItem()* method.

```
//syntax
localStorage.getItem('key')
```

```
let firstName = localStorage.getItem('firstName')
let age = localStorage.getItem('age')
let skills = localStorage.getItem('skills')
console.log(firstName, age, skills)
```

```
 'Asabeneh', '200', '['HTML','CSS','JS','React']'
```

As you can see the skill is in a string format. Let us use JSON.parse() to parse it to normal array.

```
let skills = localStorage.getItem('skills')
let skillsObj = JSON.parse(skills, undefined, 4)
console.log(skillsObj)
```

```
['HTML','CSS','JS','React']
```

### Clearing the localStorage

The clear method, will clear everything stored in the local storage

`localStorage.clear()`
